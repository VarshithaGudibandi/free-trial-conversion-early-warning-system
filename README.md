# Free-to-Paid Conversion Early Warning System

An interactive analytics and risk-scoring tool to identify high-risk free-trial users early and improve subscription conversion through targeted product interventions.

## Problem Context
Free trials are a major acquisition channel for subscription products, but a large percentage of users churn before converting to paid plans. Most teams only realize churn at the end of the trial, when it is too late to intervene.

This project focuses on identifying early behavioral signals during the trial period to proactively reduce churn and improve free-to-paid conversion.

## What I Built
- Early churn risk scoring based on user engagement signals
- Feature engineering for activation and engagement metrics
- User segmentation into High, Medium, and Low churn risk
- An interactive tool to explore trial health and intervention opportunities
- Experiment-ready outputs to support product decision-making

## Interactive Tool
This project includes an interactive prototype that allows product teams to:
- Analyze trial user engagement
- Identify users at risk of churn before trial expiry
- Explore conversion patterns by activation level
- Simulate targeted interventions for different user segments

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit (or CLI-based tool)
- Cursor (AI-assisted development for rapid iteration)

## Key Insights
- Users who fail to activate within the first 7 days have the highest churn risk
- Medium-risk users show the highest potential lift from targeted nudges
- Behavioral signals outperform generic trial reminders in predicting conversion

## Results
Results are simulated using a realistic subscription dataset for demonstration purposes.
- Estimated 18–25% improvement in free-to-paid conversion
- Reduction in inactive trial churn
- Faster time-to-first-value for activated users

## How This Would Be Used in a Real Product
- Integrated with CRM and lifecycle messaging tools
- Trigger personalized onboarding and feature education
- Inform roadmap prioritization for activation improvements
